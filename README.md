- 👋 Hi, I’m Harshil Naik!
I'm an Aerospace engineering student from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, currently pursuing my dream in the field of robotics and autonomous vehicles. 

- 👀 I’m interested in Guidance and Control strategies for autonomous robots, particularly aerial vehicles and quadrupeds.
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Multi Agent systems and their formation control, decentralized bias estimation and exploration strategies. Other than that, I'm learning about different learning based and optimization based methods to suppliment my knowledge.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything regarding autonomous robotics and knitting (a hobby of mine)
